### Hi there 👋

I'm the founder and CEO of [DevResults](https://www.devresults.com), a small, distributed,
bootstrapped company that makes monitoring and evaluation software used by international aid
projects.

Recently, I've been spending a lot of time thinking about how to solve some of my fundamental
frustrations with the way software works.

I believe that my software should:

1. 🛠️ let me **change** it to fit my needs
2. 🛫 let me work **offline**
3. 📦 give me **control** over my stuff
4. 🔌 **integrate** with other software

I've put a lot of my energy lately into the repos at
[@local-first-web](https://github.com/local-first-web), which address points 2 and 3 on that list:

- [@localfirst/state](https://github.com/local-first-web/state) is an automatically replicated Redux
  store that gives your app offline capabilities and secure peer-to-peer synchronization
  superpowers.

- [@localfirst/auth](https://github.com/local-first-web/auth) provides decentralized authentication
  and authorization for team collaboration, using a secure chain of cryptographic signatures.

- [@localfirst/relay](https://github.com/local-first-web/relay) is a tiny service that helps
  local-first applications connect with peers on other devices. It can run in the cloud or on any
  device with a known address.

I was born in the US, grew up in Panama and Ecuador, and taught math in Gabon and Guinea as a Peace
Corps volunteer.

I've lived in Barcelona since 2016.
