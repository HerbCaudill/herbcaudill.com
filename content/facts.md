### Hi there 👋

I'm the founder and CEO of [DevResults](https://www.devresults.com), a small, distributed, bootstrapped company that makes monitoring and evaluation software used by international aid projects.

Recently, I've been spending a lot of time thinking about how to solve some of my fundamental frustrations with the way software works.

I believe that my software should:

1. 🐱‍💻 let me **change** it to fit my needs
2. 🛫 let me work **offline**
3. 📦 give me **control** over my stuff
4. 🔌 **integrate** with other software

I've put a lot of my energy lately into the repos at [@local-first-web](https://github.com/local-first-web), which address points 2 and 3 on that list:

- [@localfirst/state](https://github.com/local-first-web/state) is an automatically replicated Redux store that gives your app offline capabilities and secure peer-to-peer synchronization superpowers.
- [@localfirst/auth](https://github.com/local-first-web/auth) provides decentralized authentication and authorization for team collaboration, using a secure chain of cryptographic signatures.
- [@localfirst/relay](https://github.com/local-first-web/relay) is a tiny service that helps local-first applications connect with peers on other devices. It can run in the cloud or on any device with a known address.

I was born in the US, grew up in Panama and Ecuador, and taught math in Gabon and Guinea as a Peace Corps volunteer.

I've lived in Barcelona since 2016.
